# [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5)

This solution was done in Rust. Run `rustc day5.rs` to compile, and `day5` to see the answer. You'll need to change some code near the beginning to adjust the input value.

Due to my "different language every day" goal, I had to re-write part 2 in Rust before starting.

While this probably isn't the best first introduction, I'm not a huge fan of Rust. There's a lot of really wild syntax that's hard to understand as someone new to the language. I did really enjoy today's puzzle, though.
