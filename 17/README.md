# [Day 17](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/17)

This solution was done by hand, with the assistant of Day 9's solution and another helper program. Run `g++ -o day9 ../09/day9.cpp` to compile the Intcode computer. Count the `O`s in `map` to get the answer to part 1, and run `cat zipped | ./day9` to get the answer to part 2.

I've included some of the files I made in the process of doing this by hand. `map` is the ASCII scaffolding map with the intersections marked with `O`s, and `zipped` is the de-ASCII'd inputs.

Seems like most people did this problem (or at least part 2) by hand. When the advent is over, I might revisit this one and try to code a solution for both parts since it seems like an interesting compression problem.
