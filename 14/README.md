# [Day 14](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/14)

This solution was done in Kotlin. Run `kotlinc day14.kt -include-runtime -d day14.jar` to compile, and run `java -jar day14.jar` to get the answers.

This was a fun problem, although I'm pretty sure part 2 could have been done in a fancier way, but I'm glad that nearly brute forcing the part 1 solution over and over was still performant enough to work for part 2. I thought this problem would require some debugging and might be a little challenge, so I used a language I was somewhat familiar with (I'm very familiar with Java at least). In retrospect, I might have gotten by using a wilder language for this one.
