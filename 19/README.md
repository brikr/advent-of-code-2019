# [Day 19](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/19)

This solution was done in Go, but relies on day 9's solution as the intcode computer. Run `g++ -o day9 ../09/day9.cpp` to compile the intcode computer, and then run `go run day19.go` to get the answers.

This was a fun problem to solve, and I'm glad that interaction with the Intcode computer was minimal. I'm pretty happy with my solution, although I bet I could have been doing the modified binary search a bit more in part 2 to make it run even faster. Luckily, Go is pretty performant.
