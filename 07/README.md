# [Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/7)

This solution was done in C. Run `gcc -o day7 day7.c` to compile, and then run `./day7` to get the answers.

The third intcode problem has me wondering how many times I'll be rewriting this intcode computer in different languages. Luckily I'm enjoying it. This was definitely the hardest problem yet; it helped that I was doing it in a language I was somewhat familiar with, although I certainly spent plenty of time debugging errors that would only occur in C.
